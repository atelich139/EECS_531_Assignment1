    This is the first exercise in assignment 1. The object of this exercise was to
implement an image blur filter "by hand".

    I chose to implement a Gaussian image blur filter. The following python code contains
functions for creating a kernel (of any kind and size), a function for computing a 2D
Gaussian transformation, and a function for performing convolution.

    The write up explaining the math behind Gaussian image blurring and displaying my
results is in LaTeX format and the formatted pdf is attached.
