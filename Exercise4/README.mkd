After more research, I realized that the reason that I was not able to find a way to generate an ROC curve for my corner detection classifier because the classifier was not a probabilistic classifier. If I wanted to generate an ROC curve for this classifier, I would have to generate a probability distribution of the frequency of the acceptable values (the values of the Eigan vectors that I would chose to be acceptable for a corner to be present) vs. the total values for the attributes of a corner collected when iterating over the image pixels.
